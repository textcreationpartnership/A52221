         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

What is it? for heavens sake tell me, is pay day come? but why should I aske such an unseasonable question, when twenty daies, (pay daies I meane) are past since I received one crosse of my Captaine; has my Captaine received any mony lately? or does he intend to ransacke the inscrutable bagges of gouty Mr. <hi>Gripe,</hi> the forty i'th hundred man? or what other newes is it good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Wheeler?</hi>

               <p>And you are glad of these tydings, are you? you believe now that your hens may walke safely and none bee borrowed, none shall hereafter come limping home, who have miraculously escaped our clutches, which hapned seldome, unlesse we were overloaden; your Geese may graze securely, and not be continually confin'd to their pens, your Ducks, Turkies, and all other Poultry may encrease and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply like the Sisters of St. Antholines.</p>

               <p>For my part I have not any to encrease at all, (thankes to your ragged Regiment) but since I heard of this good newes, I intend to revive my stock, my harmelesse sheepe I hope now may rest securely in their folds and not be afraid of the night wolves, nor I in the morning be constrained to use the Art of Subtraction, 25. being taken out of 80. to know I have fifty five onely remaining: beleeve me Master <hi>Dammeeslash</hi> your disease was more infectious to them then the rot, my hogs may now (with your leave) walke abroad all day, and retire at night to their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereas before your company was so mercilesse that (although they were sent on Canterburies embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) they would not spare the Parsons tyth Pigge, but it must goe into the number, my Calves were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ten dayes old, but one of your noble order long'd for it, marry my Kine themselves you have made bold with too; but I beseech you Sir without offence to your feather, may I aske you a question, had you any Butchers among you to dresse your meat?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dammee.</speaker>
               <p>Butchers? yes, enow, of every Artificers Trade we had some, but especially of Shoomakers and Taylors, whom you might easily distinguish from
<pb facs="tcp:37942:3"/> the rest. The Shoomakers were they that contrary to their Charter, were drunke two dayes a weeke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Sunday and Munday, and the Taylors were they that eat so much hot Bread and Butter, they were no great drunkards, and the reason why so many Knights of the Needle turn'd souldiers, was because there was not roome enough in Blackefryers for the French men of that trade; but me thinkes you should rather bee sorry then rejoyce at the losse of so good company, we were ever sociable, wee could not en-endure that you should want company on a Sunday at dinner.</p>

               <p>That's true indeed Sir, you came both Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Munday many times, but it was before you were sent for, I did not take any great delight in your pleasant society, good I am sure you never did mee any, unlesse by keeping my meat from stinking, or by ridding me of the loud clamors my wife would whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into my eares, for I could never have her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny so long as you or your ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>Dam.</speaker>
               <p>Why, had your wife ever such service done her from your weake backe as she had from us, your daughters too, puling fooles, how did they looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we tooke them in hand? how they were troubled with the greene sicknesse, and lov'd no diet, but lime, chalke, and oatmeale, before they were our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, wee prescribed them wholsome pils that tooke off that feminine disease, they I warrant them
